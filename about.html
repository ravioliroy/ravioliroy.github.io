<h1> Our Vision </h1>

<p> We want our oranization to enlighten people on sexual health. We have 

far too many
citzens in Memphis that have been unable to receive proper sexual education
in our city, whether it be due to a lack of resources in their area of the 

city or a severe under-representation of sexual education in their school 

curriculum. In creating this program, we hope to bridge the gap between 

various parts of the city regarding the knowledge they have on the subject 

of sexual health. Everyone has the right to know how to keep their body 

healthy. To this end, we have come together to develop this program in the 

hopes that it will bring about a wider understanding of sexual health, and 

why it is important that our city knows the best ways we can keep our sexual 

encounters safe and our bodies clean. </p>
